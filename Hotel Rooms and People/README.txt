Objectives: 
Create a Person class and a HotelRoom class with their own constructors.
Person(double h, int a, String n, String hC)
HotelRoom(int roomNum)

The Person class should have basic information about them:
height (double)
age (age)
name (String)
hairColor (String)
The HotelRoom should have the following attributes:
 Person(s) currently residing in it, up to 2 guests.
guestOne (Person)
guestTwo (Person)
roomNumber (int)

The HotelRoom class should have the following methods:
checkIn(Person guest): to check in guests.
checkOut(Person guest): to check guests out.
checkCapacity(): to determine if a HotelRoom object has reached capacity (2).
printGuestInfo(): to print the guests and their information (attributes) currently residing in the HotelRoom object.
(optional) You may make methods in the Person or HotelRoom class to aid in this process.
You must add comments on your code explaining the purpose behind code segments and class methods (use // )

Tests:
Must be able to add a person to the hotel room.
Must be able to remove a specific person from the hotel room (person 1 or person 2)
If you attempt to add a 3rd person to the room, print out that it is full and do not add them to the room.
Be able to retrieve and print out each Person in the roomâ€™s information.




make a g1
make a g2

capacity = 0

when add() information
    g1= name
    g1_


when add guests, check capacity.
    if 0 || 1 then you can add them
        g1 = 
    else print that it is full (has 2 people already)
